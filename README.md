Seventeen Website 
I have created a website for a boy band group. I chose a korean pop boy group: Seventeen, among all other boy groups. The website I created is a simple introductory of the k-pop boy group that includes the members name, their discography: albums and videos, as well as their social links. These should give an idea to those who view the website of the k-pop boy group: Seventeen. 

Design Process 
My initial idea for this website is much more complex and detailed. I wanted to have an elaborated description of each members, a section to display their awards, a section to display their previous and upcoming concerts, and a gallery of the members and group. 

These would have allow user's to know more about the group and view related resources of the group. 

Features 
First page: This page is a very simple page on introduction of each members. From the top, there is the name of the group: Seventeen. Then, there is the navigation bar to view the other webpages. Below the navigation bar, there is a photo of the group to introduce to the users who is Seventeen. Afterwards, below it is the main section of the page which is introduction of each of the members. Users will be able to hover onto each member's picture and the name of the member will show. 

Second page: This page displays Seventeen's discography which includes their albums and youtube videos. From the top, there is the page title and navigation bar. Then, there is the images of the albums. When hover onto the images, it should flip horizontally to the back side of the image which reveals the description of the albums. Below the album section, there is videos on Seventeen's music videos and variety show. There should be a button for the first video to play and pause the video. 

Third page: This page displays Seventeen's social links which includes their Weverse website, Youtube Channel, Instagram page, and Twitter page. There is a table which displays the name of the link and the link to the various social medias. 

Testing 
The website is quite responsive on computers. However, on phones, it is quite inconsistent. Images display is okay but the border for the navigation bar and title is not as responsive.
